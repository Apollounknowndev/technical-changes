pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 20.

entity nbt breaking | Non-living entities with a `CustomName` will now show their name when looked at, or always if `CustomNameVisible` is set.

command breaking | The `/function` command no longer has a result unless it uses `/return`, it will no longer return the number of commands executed.

command gamerule breaking | The `maxCommandChainLength` game rule now counts operations more strictly.

command gamerule | Added game rule `maxCommandForkCount`, which restricts the total amount of contexts that can be created by commands like `/execute as @e`.

command | Reintroduced the `/execute if function` subcommand, with syntax:
* `execute if|unless function <function> <continuation>`: executes a function (tag) and matches if the return value is not `0`.

command | Reintroduced the `/return run` subcommand, with syntax:
* `return run <command>`: takes the return value from the `command` and returns it as the return value of the function. Does not return if the `command` was a function and that function did not return. Returns `0` if the command failed.

particle | Added particle type `dust_plume`.
