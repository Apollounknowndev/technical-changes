game-event | A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations. The initial game events are `step`, `swim`, `flap`, `elytra_free_fall`, `hit_ground`, `splash`, `projectile_shoot`, `projectile_land`, `entity_hit`, `block_place`, `block_destroy`, `fluid_place`, `fluid_pickup`, `block_open`, `block_close`, `block_switch`, `block_unswitch`, `block_attach`, `block_detach`, `block_press`, `block_unpress`, `container_open`, `container_close`, `explode`, `armor_stand_add_item`, `wolf_shaking`, `dispense_fail`, `fishing_rod_cast`, `fishing_rod_reel_in`, `piston_extend`, `piston_contract`, `flint_and_steel_use`, `eating_start`, `eating_finish`, and `lightning_strike`.

tag game-event | Added game event tags. There are currently two game event tags from vanilla:
* `vibrations` determines which game events are detected by the Sculk Sensor. Currently contains all game events.
* `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` determines which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the event source is sneaking. Currently contain `step`, `hit_ground`, and `projectile_shoot`.

tag data | Add block tags `dripstone_replaceable_blocks`, `occludes_vibration_signals`.

options | Removed `max-build-height` server property.

particle | Added particles `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`.

worldgen | Changed dimension type. Added `min_y` and `height` fields which determine the build limit in the dimension.

worldgen | Changed noise settings. Added `noise.min_y` field (`height` already existed), these determine the range where terrain will generate in the dimension.

worldgen | Added features `dripstone_cluster`, `large_dripstone` and `small_dripstone`
