gamerule | Added `playersSleepingPercentage` game rule, which defaults to `100`. It controls what percentage of players must sleep to skip the night. A value of `0` means 1 player is always enough, values above `100` will prevent skipping the night.

game-event | Removed the game event `eating_start`.

tag data | Added item tags `axolotl_tempt_items` and `occludes_vibration_signals`.

tag data | Added entity type tags `axolotl_always_hostiles` and `axolotl_tempted_hostiles`.

assets | Added texture for the bundle GUI `gui/container/bundle.png`.
