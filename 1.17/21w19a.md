jar | Updated to Java 16.

command | Changed the syntax of the `/item` command. The new syntax:
* `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` same as the old `replaceitem` command.
* `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` copies an item from the source to the target and optionally modifies the item.
* `/item modify <target> <modifier>` modifies the item without copying.

tag data | Added block tags `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe`, and `mineable/shovel`. Blocks in these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the maching tool.

tag data | Added block tags `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool`, and `needs_diamond_tool`. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
