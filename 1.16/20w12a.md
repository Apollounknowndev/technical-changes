nbt entity | Changed how UUIDs are stored in all places. They are now represented as an array of 4 integers. Renamed some fields:
* `OwnerUUID` -> `Owner`
* `TrustedUUIDs` -> `Trusted` (foxes)
* `target_uuid` -> `Target` (conduits)

loot predicate | Added `fishing_hook` parameter in entity predicates, which checks properties of the fishing hook. It's an object with one parameter: `in_open_water` (boolean).
