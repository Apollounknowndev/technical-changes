They share common tags: `transformation`, `interpolation_duration`, `interpolation_start`, `billboard`, `view_range`, `shadow_radius`, `shadow_strength`, `width`, `height`, `glow_color_override`, `brightness`.
* `block_display`: Has field `block_state`.
* `item_display`: Has fields `item` and `item_display`.
