pack breaking | Data pack format has been increased to 10.

pack breaking | Resource pack format has been increased to 9.

text font | Added `space` glyph provider. It has a single field `advances` which is a map of codepoints to glyph advance (width). This enables custom space widths, including negative spaces.

text font breaking | Font providers now manually need to declare the space glyph.

pack | Added optional field `filter` to `pack.mcmeta`. When present, must have a `block` field which is a list of patterns, which hides resources in packs loaded before the current pack that match the pattern.  
The following example removes all advancements in the minecraft namespace:
```json
{
	"pack": { },
	"filter": {
		"block": [
			{
				"namespace": "^minecraft$",
				"path": "^advancements/.*"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

loot predicate | Renamed location predicate field `feature` to `structure`.

worldgen | Removed dimension field `seed`.

worldgen | Changed noise settings. Removed field `terrain_shaper`, the terrain shaper splines have been moved to density functions. Added field `spawn_target`, which is a list of target points (like )

worlgen | Removed biome field `category`. Functionality has been moved to biome tags.

worldgen | Added feature type `sculk_patch`. It has 5 required integer fields: `charge_count`, `amount_per_charge`, `spread_attempts`, `growth_rounds`, and `spread_rounds` and 1 required float field: `catalyst_chance`.

worldgen | Changed structure set placement.
* Fields `salt` and `locate_offset` are no longer specific to the `random_spread` placement type.
* Added field `preferred_biomes` to the placement type `concentric_rings`, which is a biome tag.
* Added optional field `exclusion_zone`, which is an object with two fields: `other_set` - a structure set reference, and `chunk_count` - an integer between 1 and 16
* Added optional fields `frequency` - a number between 0 and 1, and `frequency_reduction_method`, which is one of `default`, `legacy_type_1`, `legacy_type_2`, or `legacy_type_3`.

worldgen | Moved `worldgen/configured_structure_feature` to `worldgen/structure` folder.

worldgen | Changed structure fields:
* Added field `step` which is one of `raw_generation`, `lakes`, `local_modifications`, `underground_structures`, `surface_structures`, `strongholds`, `underground_ores`, `underground_decoration`, `fluid_springs`, `vegetal_decoration`, or `top_layer_modification`.
* All fields that were in `config` are now in the root.
* Merged `village`, `bastion_remnant` and `pillager_outpost` types to `jigsaw`, and added the fields `start_height` - a height provider, `project_start_to_heightmap` - an optional heightmap type, and `use_expansion_hack` - a boolean.
* For the `ruined_portal` type: removed field `portal_type` and replaced it with a weighted list `setups`.
* Removed fields `probability`, this is instead being controlled by the structure set `frequency` settings.

worldgen | Added world presets, stored in the `worldgen/world_preset` directory. It has a single field `dimensions`, which is a map of dimension IDs to dimension settings, previously in the `dimension` folder.
