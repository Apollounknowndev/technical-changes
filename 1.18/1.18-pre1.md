worldgen jar data | The `--reports` option in data generator now exports full vanilla worldgen reference files, instead of only biomes.

worldgen | Added placed features, stored in the data pack folder `worldgen/placed_feature`. They reference a configured feature and a list of configured decorators.

worldgen | Changed feature `twisting_vines`. Added fields `spread_width`, `spread_height`, and `max_height` which are all positive integers.

worldgen | Changed feature `nether_forest_vegetation`. Added fields `spread_width` and `spread_height` which are both positive integers.

worldgen | Changed feature `lake`. Removed field `state` and added fields `fluid` and `barrier` which are both block state providers.

worldgen | Renamed surface rule field `run_depth_multiplier` -> `surface_depth_multiplier`.

worldgen | Changed surface condition `stone_depth`. Added fields `offset` which is an int and `add_surface_secondary_depth` which is a boolean. Renamed field `add_run_depth` -> `add_surface_depth`.

worldgen | Added block predicate `solid` which tests if the block material is solid.

worldgen | Added block predicate `inside_world_bounds` which tests if the location is inside the (vertical) world bounds. It has an optional `offset` field which takes a block pos.

worldgen | Removed decorators `decorated`, `dark_oak_tree`, `iceberg`, `count_extra`, `lava_lake`, `cave_surface`, `end_gateway`, and `nope`.

worldgen | Renamed decorators:
* `count_multilayer` -> `count_on_every_layer`
* `square` -> `in_square`
* `scatter` -> `random_offset`
* `chance` -> `rarity_filter`
* `count_noise` -> `noise_threshold_count`
* `count_noise_biased` -> `noise_based_count`
* `surface_relative_threshold` -> `surface_relative_threshold_filter`
* `water_depth_threshold` -> `surface_water_depth_filter`
* `range` -> `height_range`
* `block_filter` -> `block_predicate_filter`

worldgen | Added decorator `biome`. Checks that the current feature exists in the biome at this position.
