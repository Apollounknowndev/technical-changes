level | Changed chunk storage. Removed the `Level` field and moved everything it contained up. Renamed fields:
* `Entities` -> `entities`
* `TileEntities` -> `block_entities`
* `TileTicks` and `ToBeTicked` -> `block_ticks`
* `LiquidTicks` and `LiquidsToBeTicked` -> `fluid_ticks`
* `Sections` -> `sections`
* `Structures` -> `structures`
* `Structures.Starts` -> `structures.starts`
...
Added fields:
* `yPos` the minimum Y position in the chunk.
* `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below Y=0 generation.
* `blending_data` containing data to support world blending.

worldgen | Changed noise settings. Added field `noise.terrain_shaper`, defining the terrain shape using nested splines. It has 3 spline fields `offset`, `factor`, and `jaggedness`.
...
Splines can either be constant numbers, or objects that define a spline. They have 2 fields:
* `coordinate` a string defining what noise to use, one of `continents`, `erosion`, `weirdness`, or `ridges`
* `points` an array of objects with a number field `location`, number `derivative`, and a nested spline `value`.
