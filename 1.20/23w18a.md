pack breaking | Data pack format has been increased to 15.

advancement | Added field `sends_telemetry_event` (boolean) to advancements. It defaults to false.

loot predicate breaking | Renamed the `alternative` condition to `any_of`.

loot predicate | Added the `all_of` condition. It has a field `terms` and passes only if all the terms pass.

advancement breaking | Changed the `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block`, and `allay_drop_item_on_block` advancement triggers. All fields are now collapsed into `location` which is no longer just a location predicate. It now accepts a list of loot conditions, just like the `player` condition.
