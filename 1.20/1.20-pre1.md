damage-type | Added damage types `outside_border` and `generic_kill`.

command | Changed the `/data` command. The `string` data source now accepts negavive boundaries, which are interpreted as an index counted from the end of the string.

loot | Added field `random_sequence` (resource location) to loot tables. Loot tables now use deterministric random sequences based on both the world seed and the hash of the value of this field.

options | The `server.properties` file is now read and written with UTF-8 encoding, although it supports the previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback when reading.
