recipe | `minecraft:air` is no longer allowed in a recipe to specify an empty slot in a smithing recipe. Instead ingredients in array form are now also allowed, which can be empty arrays to signalize that slots needs to be left empty.

loot | If the `random_sequence` is not specified, the loot table will now use a non-deterministic random source (the old behavior) instead of using a deterministic random sequence.
